Tic-Tac-Toe created with python
Very inefficient and bad code but it works

V1: Initial version using simple X and O characters in the command line
V2: Updated version with terrible X and O 3x3 symbols made by characters, accompanied by an even worse board management system
V3: UI using tkinter, clicking on the final message closes
V3.5: Fixed the issue of taking input and detecting new wins after game over
V3.6: Fixed the issue of still taking user input after game over
